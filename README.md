# Machine-Learning-Implementations

This repo contains various IPython notebooks I've created to experiment with libraries and implementations of the exercises presented in Andrew Ng's "Machine Learning" class on Coursera. The course's objective was to teach the implementation of the various machine learning techniques from scratch in Octave, and I decided to re implement these algorithms (from scratch) in Python. The algorithms implemented are the following -

### Exercise 1 - Linear Regression

### Exercise 2 - Logistic Regression

### Exercise 3 - Multi-Class Classification

### Exercise 4 - Neural Networks

### Exercise 6 - Support Vector Machines

### Exercise 7 - K-Means Clustering & PCA

### Exercise 8 - Anomaly Detection & Recommendation Systems
