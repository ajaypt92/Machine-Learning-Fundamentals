# Machine-Learning-Implementations

This repo contains various IPython notebooks I've created to experiment with libraries and implementations of the exercises presented in Andrew Ng's "Machine Learning" class on Coursera. The course's objective was to teach the implementation of the various machine learning techniques from scratch in Octave, and I decided to re implement these algorithms (from scratch) in Python.  I've included notebook viewer links below.  Click the link to see a live rendering of the notebook.
